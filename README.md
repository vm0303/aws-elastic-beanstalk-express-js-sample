# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Node.js Sample App
In this hands-on tutorial from AWS, we will be creating a continuous delivery pipeline for a simple web application. We will first use a version control system (aka GitHub) to store the source code. Then, we will learn how to create a continuous delivery pipeline that will automatically deploy the web application whenever the source code is updated.

This repository contains a sample Node.js web application built using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), meant to be used as part of the AWS DevOps Learning Path.

## What we will be doing

This tutorial will teach us the steps to create the continuous delivery pipeline discussed above. We will learn to:

- Set up a GitHub repository for the application code
- Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment to deploy the application
- Configure AWS CodeBuild to build the source code from GitHub
- Use AWS CodePipeline to set up the continuous delivery pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages
